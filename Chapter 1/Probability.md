# Probability and Information Theory

Probability models uncertaintiy

3 sources of uncertainty

1. Inherent stochasticity in the system beind modeled
2. Incomplete observability of data
3. Incomplete modeling from generalization

When modeling systems, **Simple but unceratin rules >> Complex but certain rules**

Frequentist vs Bayesian Probability:

Frequentist only rely on observations, without prior information

Bayesians rely of prior information to construct probability
