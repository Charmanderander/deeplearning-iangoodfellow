## Machine Learning Basics

>> A computer program is said to learn from experince E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P improves with experience E

## 1.Learning Algorithms

Task T: Classification, Regression, Transcription, Machine Translation, Structured Output, Anomaly Detection, Synthesis and Sampling, Imputation of missing values, Denoising, Density Estimation

Performance P: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC, F-score, RMSE ...

Experience E: Unsupervised, Supervised, Reinforcement Learning

## 2. Capacity, Overfitting, Underfitting

The central challenge in machine learning is making it **generalizable** to unseen datasets

In the data generation process, **i.i.d Assumption** assumes that the datasets are independent, and identically distributed

Underfitting occurs when the model is not able to obtain a sufficiently low error on the training set

Overfitting occurs when the difference between the training error and testing error is high

We can control a model's tendency to over/underfit by changing it's capacity.

A model's capacity is it's ability to fit a wide variety of functions.

Models with low capacity may struggle to fit the training set, while models with high capacity can overfit the training set by memorizing the properties of the training set that may not be present in the test set.

One way to control the model's capacity is to choose it's **hypothesis space**, which is the set of functions that the model is allowed to select as being the solution

>> Example: In linear regression, we can increase the capcity by allowing it to include polynomials, rather than just linear functions.

**Models perform best when their capcity approximately captures the complexity of the task they need to perform**

Other than changing the amount of input features and adding new parameters to those features, we can change the capacity by allowing the model to choose which family of functions to choose from. This is called **representational capacity**.
